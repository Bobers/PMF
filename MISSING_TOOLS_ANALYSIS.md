## Data Entry Gaps

### Manual Entry Required For:
1. **Every customer interview** (35+ entries)
2. **Channel performance data** (daily/weekly)
3. **User feedback** (ongoing)
4. **Metric calculations** (weekly)
5. **Relationship mappings** (complex many-to-many)

### Missing Integrations:
- **Analytics:** Mixpanel, Amplitude, Google Analytics
- **CRM:** HubSpot, Pipedrive
- **Surveys:** Typeform, SurveyMonkey
- **Communication:** Intercom, Slack
- **Payments:** Stripe, Paddle
- **Support:** Zendesk, Help Scout

## Workflow Automation Needs

### Critical Automations:

   - Auto-extract mentions
   - Update validation rates
   - Calculate confidence

2. **Metrics → PMF Score**
   - Pull retention data
   - Calculate referral rates
   - Update PMF score

3. **Feedback → Insights**
   - Sentiment analysis
   - Theme extraction
   - Segment classification

4. **Experiments → Decisions**
   - Track success criteria
   - Statistical analysis
   - Auto-close experiments

## UI Components Needed

### Core Interfaces:

## Priority Implementation Order

### Phase 1: Core Capture (Week 1-2)
1. Interview management system
2. Problem validation tracker
3. Basic metrics dashboard

### Phase 2: Analysis (Week 3-4)
4. Sean Ellis test runner
5. Segment analyzer
6. Four fits calculator

### Phase 3: Automation (Week 5-6)
7. Analytics integrations
8. Automated scoring
9. Decision support

### Phase 4: Optimization (Week 7-8)
10. Experiment management
11. Advanced visualizations
12. Predictive analytics

## Estimated Effort

**Total Components:** ~25 major tools
**Development Time:** 3-4 months for MVP suite
**Integration Time:** 1-2 months
**Testing & Refinement:** 1 month

**Total:** 5-7 months for complete platform

## The Reality Check

Without these tools, EMU's team would need to:
- Manually track 100+ interviews in spreadsheets
- Calculate validation rates by hand
- Update dozens of database tables directly
- Create custom reports for every decision
- Manage complex relationships without visualization

**This is why most startups don't do systematic PMF validation - the tooling doesn't exist!**
