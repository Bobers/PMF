# EMU's AI-Assisted PMF Workflow

## How the Hybrid System Actually Works

### 1. **Interview Input ‚Üí AI Extraction**

**Human Input:**
```
"Just interviewed Sarah, founder of DataSync. She said:
'We spent 6 months building features nobody wanted. Had 300 signups 
but 2% conversion. Our Excel-based solution works but it's painful. 
We tape together 5 different tools. Would pay $500/mo for something 
that just worked. This is our biggest operational headache.'"
```

**AI Populates:**
```typescript
// Problems (extracted)
- title: "Manual data sync is error-prone and time-consuming"
- severity_score: 8 (based on "biggest operational headache")
- current_solution_inadequacy: 8 ("painful", "tape together")
- has_workarounds: true
- workaround_description: "Excel + 5 different tools"
- willingness_to_pay: true
- urgency_level: "immediate"

// Evidence
- unprompted_mentions: +1
- validation_signal: strong
- price_point_mentioned: 500

// Segment signals
- company_type: "B2B SaaS"
- stage: "Post-launch" (300 signups)
- problem_awareness: "solution_aware"
```

**Human Validates:**
- ‚úÖ Confirms severity is 8
- üìù Edits title to be more specific
- ‚úÖ Approves other fields
- üîí Locks the entry

### 2. **Bulk Interview Analysis**

**After 20 interviews uploaded:**

**AI Analyzes Patterns:**
```typescript
// Automated Problem Clustering
{
  "problem_clusters": [
    {
      "theme": "Data integration pain",
      "mentions": 15,
      "severity_avg": 8.2,
      "quotes": ["tape together tools", "manual sync", "Excel hell"]
    },
    {
      "theme": "Lack of process",
      "mentions": 12,
      "severity_avg": 7.5,
      "quotes": ["no system", "chaos", "guessing"]
    }
  ],
  
  "validation_rate": 0.75,  // 15/20 validated main problem
  "willingness_to_pay": 0.65,  // 13/20 would pay
  "price_range": "$200-500/mo",
  
  "segment_breakdown": {
    "seed_stage": { "count": 8, "severity": 8.5 },
    "growth_stage": { "count": 12, "severity": 7.2 }
  }
}
```

**Human Actions:**
- üëÄ Reviews AI clustering
- ‚úèÔ∏è Merges two similar problems
- ‚ûï Adds missed insight
- üîí Approves final analysis

### 3. **Solution Generation from Problems**

**AI Suggests Solutions:**
```typescript
// Based on problem: "Manual data sync is painful"
{
  "suggested_solutions": [
    {
      "title": "One-click integration marketplace",
      "addresses_problems": ["manual_sync", "tool_fragmentation"],
      "effort_estimate": 8,
      "impact_estimate": 9,
      "90_10_rule": false  // Too complex for MVP
    },
    {
      "title": "Automated sync with 5 core tools",
      "addresses_problems": ["manual_sync"],
      "effort_estimate": 5,
      "impact_estimate": 8,
      "90_10_rule": true  // Good MVP candidate
    }
  ]
}
```

**Human Decides:**
- üéØ Selects MVP solution
- ‚ôªÔ∏è Asks AI to regenerate with constraints
- ‚úèÔ∏è Edits final solution design
- üîí Locks core feature set

### 4. **Sean Ellis Test Analysis**

**Survey Responses Uploaded:**
```
73 responses from Typeform CSV
```

**AI Calculates:**
```typescript
{
  "overall_results": {
    "very_disappointed": 0.42,
    "somewhat_disappointed": 0.31,
    "not_disappointed": 0.27
  },
  
  "ai_segmentation": {
    "power_users": {
      "very_disappointed": 0.71,
      "common_traits": ["daily_active", "seed_stage", "technical_founder"]
    },
    "casual_users": {
      "very_disappointed": 0.22,
      "common_traits": ["weekly_active", "growth_stage", "non_technical"]
    }
  },
  
  "key_themes": {
    "love": ["finally have a process", "saves hours weekly", "team alignment"],
    "improve": ["more integrations", "faster onboarding", "mobile app"]
  }
}
```

**Human Insights:**
- üîç Notices AI missed correlation with company size
- ‚ûï Adds strategic interpretation
- üìä Adjusts segment definitions
- üîí Finalizes PMF analysis

### 5. **Metric Integration & Monitoring**

**Automated Data Collection:**
```typescript
// Weekly automated pull from integrations
{
  "stripe": { "mrr": 11644, "new_customers": 7, "churn": 2 },
  "mixpanel": { 
    "wau": 142, 
    "retention_w1": 0.83,
    "feature_usage": { "workflow": 0.91, "ai_assist": 0.67 }
  },
  "hubspot": { "trial_to_paid": 0.23, "sales_cycle_days": 7 }
}
```

**AI Analysis:**
```typescript
{
  "health_score": "strong",
  "alerts": [
    "Retention exceeding target by 3%",
    "Referral rate trending up 5% WoW"
  ],
  "risks": [
    "Single channel dependency (42% content)",
    "Growth stage segment churning faster"
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Test new channel this week",
    "Interview churned growth stage customers"
  ]
}
```

**Human Decision:**
- ‚úÖ Acknowledges alerts
- üìã Prioritizes channel diversification
- üéØ Sets next week's experiments
- üîí Approves strategic direction

## The Actual Workflow

### Week 1: Problem Discovery
1. **Upload** 10 interview recordings/notes
2. **AI extracts** problems, severity, patterns
3. **Human reviews**, edits, locks
4. **AI suggests** which problems to validate further
5. **Human decides** interview questions for round 2

### Week 2-3: Deep Validation
1. **Upload** 25 more interviews
2. **AI calculates** validation rates, segments
3. **Human adjusts** problem definitions
4. **AI identifies** highest-value segment
5. **Human approves** target market focus

### Week 4: Solution Design
1. **AI generates** solution options from problems
2. **Human selects** MVP features
3. **AI estimates** effort/impact
4. **Human adjusts** and locks roadmap

### Week 5-8: Build & Test
1. **Connect** analytics tools
2. **AI monitors** usage patterns
3. **Human interprets** qualitative feedback
4. **AI alerts** on metrics thresholds
5. **Human makes** product decisions

### Week 9-12: PMF Measurement
1. **Run** Sean Ellis test
2. **AI segments** responses
3. **Human identifies** strategic insights
4. **AI calculates** PMF score
5. **Human decides** scale or iterate

## What Makes This Work

### 1. **AI Handles the Tedious**
- Extracting insights from interviews
- Calculating validation rates
- Clustering similar problems
- Monitoring metrics
- Flagging anomalies

### 2. **Humans Make Meaning**
- Interpreting context
- Making strategic calls
- Editing for clarity
- Choosing direction
- Locking decisions

### 3. **The Loop Accelerates**
- Each cycle gets smarter
- AI learns your patterns
- Decisions get faster
- Quality improves

## Missing Pieces (Now Clear)

### Still Need:
1. **Interview Upload Interface**
   - Audio/video transcription
   - Bulk text processing
   - Tag by participant

2. **AI Training on PMF Patterns**
   - Problem extraction rules
   - Severity scoring logic
   - Validation signal detection

3. **Integration Hub**
   - Stripe webhook receiver
   - Analytics API connectors
   - Survey tool importers

4. **Smart Alerts**
   - Threshold monitoring
   - Trend detection
   - Action recommendations

5. **Decision Recording**
   - Why locked this way?
   - What was edited?
   - Strategic rationale

But the core insight is powerful: **Don't make humans fill out forms. Let them tell their story and validate AI's interpretation.**

This is actually how a senior marketer would want to work - storytelling and strategy, not data entry!
