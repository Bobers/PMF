# EMU Implementation Roadmap

## Overview
This roadmap outlines the development priorities for building EMU's core PMF validation features based on the missing tools analysis and PMF frameworks research.

## Priority 1: Core PMF Tracking (Week 1)

### 1. Interview Management System
- **Upload/paste interview notes** - Support text, audio transcription
- **AI extraction of problems and insights** - Auto-detect pain points, severity, quotes
- **Link interviews to segments** - Tag which persona each interview represents
- **Bulk analysis** - Pattern detection across multiple interviews

### 2. Problem Validation Tracker  
- **Visual problem tree** - Hierarchical view (root → symptoms → jobs-to-be-done)
- **Track validation rates** - % of interviews confirming each problem
- **Confidence scoring** - Auto-calculate based on evidence
- **Evidence linking** - Connect quotes and data to problems

### 3. Phase Progression Dashboard
- **Current phase indicator** - Discovery → Validation → Creation → Building
- **Completion requirements** - Clear gates for each phase
- **Go/no-go decisions** - Data-driven progression
- **Progress visualization** - See what's done and what's needed

## Priority 2: Analysis Tools (Week 2)

### 4. Sean Ellis Test Runner
- **Survey builder** - Create "How disappointed" surveys
- **Response collection** - Import from Typeform/Google Forms
- **Segment analysis** - Break down by persona
- **Historical tracking** - Monitor PMF score over time

### 5. Four Fits Dashboard
- **Visual relationship mapper** - See connections between fits
- **Fit score calculations** - Quantify each relationship
- **Weak link identification** - Find what needs improvement
- **Optimization suggestions** - AI-powered recommendations

### 6. Metrics Integration
- **Connect to analytics** - Mixpanel, Amplitude, GA
- **Automated calculations** - Retention, growth, referral rates
- **PMF score tracking** - Composite score dashboard
- **Alert system** - Notify when metrics drop

## Priority 3: Automation & AI (Week 3)

### 7. AI-Assisted Workflows
- **Interview transcription** - Audio → text → insights
- **Pattern recognition** - Find themes across feedback
- **Hypothesis generation** - Suggest experiments
- **Report generation** - Weekly PMF status updates

### 8. Experiment Management
- **Hypothesis builder** - Structure experiments properly
- **Success criteria** - Define clear metrics
- **Result tracking** - Log outcomes
- **Learning repository** - Build institutional knowledge

### 9. Channel Testing Suite
- **Multi-channel setup** - Test 3-5 channels simultaneously
- **Performance tracking** - CAC, LTV, conversion
- **Budget optimization** - Allocate based on performance
- **Attribution modeling** - Understand customer journey

## Priority 4: Advanced Features (Week 4+)

### 10. Pivot Detection System
- **Leading indicators** - Flag when metrics decline
- **Pivot triggers** - Alert when major change needed
- **4Ps framework** - Persona/Problem/Promise/Product pivots
- **Historical tracking** - Learn from past pivots

### 11. Market Sizing Calculator
- **TAM/SAM/SOM** - Bottom-up calculations
- **Segment economics** - LTV by persona
- **Growth projections** - Based on current metrics
- **Competitive analysis** - Market share potential

### 12. Decision Support AI
- **Next best action** - What to do next
- **Risk assessment** - Identify blind spots
- **Resource allocation** - Where to focus effort
- **Success prediction** - Likelihood of PMF

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Database Integration
- Connect UI components to Supabase schema
- Implement real-time updates
- Add data validation layers
- Set up backup/recovery

### UI/UX Priorities
- Mobile-responsive design
- Keyboard shortcuts for power users
- Export capabilities (PDF reports)
- Team collaboration features

### Security & Compliance
- Role-based access control
- Data encryption at rest
- GDPR compliance
- SOC 2 preparation

## Success Metrics for EMU

### Phase 1 Goals
- 10 teams using for problem validation
- 80% find it easier than spreadsheets
- 3x faster problem validation cycle

### Phase 2 Goals  
- 50 teams tracking PMF metrics
- 90% accuracy in PMF predictions
- 2x improvement in go/no-go decisions

### Phase 3 Goals
- 200 teams achieving PMF faster
- 50% reduction in failed products
- Industry standard for PMF validation

## Next Steps

1. Start with Interview Management System
2. Build Problem Validation Tracker
3. Create basic Phase Progression view
4. Get 5 beta users testing immediately
5. Iterate based on feedback

This roadmap will evolve based on user feedback and learnings from our own PMF journey.
